# movielandRework
Rework of the previous Movieland project with my own backend API and front-end design.

Project requires the following installations:
* Express
* React
* React-hook-form
* Yup
* React-query
* Chakra UI
* Axios

To run the client side, run the command: npm start
Client side should be visible at localhost:3000

To run the server side, run the command: npm run devStart
Server side should be accessible at localhost:5000
